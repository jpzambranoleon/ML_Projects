# TensorFlow Projects
This directory contains the projects I was assigned when I took the **DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate** course at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice).

* **fashion_mnist_classification**: build a classification model using convolutions to predict an item of clothig using the fashion mnist dataset.
* **sarcasm_detection**: a classic nlp task build an RNN/LSTM model to predict wether a comment was sarcastic or not. 
* **simple_regression**: build a simple tensorflow model with hidden layers for simple regression
