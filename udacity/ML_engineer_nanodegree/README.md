# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree
## Overview
This is the directory where I have completed the projects assigned for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. Learn advanced machine learning techniques and algorithms and how to package and deploy your models to a production environment. Gain practical experience using Amazon SageMaker to deploy trained models to a web application and evaluate the performance of your models. A/B test models and learn how to update the models as you gather more data, an important skill in industry.


## Projects
* **sentiment_analysis_project:** build, train, and deploy an ML model for sentiment analysis and using Amazon SageMaker.
* **plagiarsim_detector_project:** use feature engineering to create new features then build, train, and deploy an ML model to detech plagiarism using Amazon SageMaker.
