# Machine Learning with scikit-learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow
This repository contains code and associated files for building, training, and deploying ML models. This repository consists of a number of personal projects that I have worked on. Each project uses a variety of ML algorithms that I have practiced with.

## Folders
* **datasets**: Folder used to contain the various datasets that I have worked on.
* **pytorch**: Projects that I have worked on where I used the PyTorch library.
* **sklearn**: Projects that I have worked on where I used the scikit-learn library.
* **tensorflow**: Projects that I have worked on where I used the tensorflow library.
* **udacity**: Projects/Assignments that I have completed while enrolled in Udacity Nanodegree program.

## Noticeable work
* [sentiment_analysis_project](https://github.com/jpzambranoleon/ML_Projects/tree/main/udacity/ML_engineer_nanodegree/sentiment_analysis_project)
* [plagiarism_detector_project](https://github.com/jpzambranoleon/ML_Projects/tree/main/udacity/ML_engineer_nanodegree/plagiarism_detector_project)
