# Machine Learning with scikit-learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow
This repository contains code and associated files for building, training, and deploying ML models. This repository consists of a number of personal projects that I have worked on. Each project uses a variety of ML algorithms that I have practiced with.

## Folders
* [datasets](https://github.com/jpzambranoleon/ML_Projects/master/datasets): Folder used to contain the various datasets that I have worked on.
* [pytorch](https://github.com/jpzambranoleon/ML_Projects/master/pytorch): Projects that I have worked on where I used the PyTorch library.
* [sklearn](https://github.com/jpzambranoleon/ML_Projects/master/sklearn): Projects that I have worked on where I used the scikit-learn library.
* [tensorflow](https://github.com/jpzambranoleon/ML_Projects/master/sklearn): Projects that I have worked on where I used the tensorflow library.
